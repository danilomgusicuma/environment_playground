# Have you ever thought about how cities grow?
 
 in 2021, the urban population corresponds to 56% of the global population and by 2050 this number will be 68%.
 
 More and more, people are living in slums and we're contributing to climate changes, garbage generation and polution.
 
 Urgently, we have to think and design our cities to be more sustainable.
